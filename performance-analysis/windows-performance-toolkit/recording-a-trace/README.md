# Recording a Trace


## 1. Prepare computer to gather a performance trace
Shut down as many running programs as possible to avoid noise in the trace that is going to be recorded. Ideally, the only running software will be Windows Performance Recorder (WPR) and the browser.

## 2. Launch Windows Performance Recorder (WPR) and select options
Launch WPR and ensure the More options is expanded. Check the Edge Browser and HTML Responsiveness analysis boxes.

#### Tips and Tricks for Gathering Traces
- Try to keep background activity to an absolutely required minimum - background processes may skew both perceived performance and actual performance characteristics and affect the results - ideally you don't have any running applications beside browser and WPR.
- Identify the scenarios you're analyzing and try to keep them as atomic as possible. Imagine a site with performances problem when loading the page, scrolling and selecting something in a table. Those would be three individual scenarios:
  - Page load (from start of navigation to page load complete)
  - Scroll
  - Selecting something in the table
- If a scenario involves navigating to a site, consider beginning the scenario at about:blank. Starting at about:blank will avoid the overhead of the previous page. If it involves navigating away from a site, navigate to about:blank to complete the scenario. This will keep the noise of other sites out of the trace unless the specific interaction between sites is the issue under investigation.

## 3. Record the scenario
Click Start to begin recording. You will observe that the tool will report the size of the buffer it is using which can be helpful to understand how large the file generated will be. Execute the scenario that is being measured. Once the scenario is completed, immediately go back to WPR and click Save to stop the trace. Saving immediately after stopping will help keep the trace file small.

## 4. Analyze the trace
Now that a trace has been collected, the next step is to analyze it to see if there are optimizations that can be made. To get started, go [Analyze the trace](../analyzing-a-trace)
