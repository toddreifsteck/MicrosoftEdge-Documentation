# Performance Analysis

## New to Performance? [Start with F12.](../f12-devtools-guide)
The F12 tools built into Microsoft Edge can be used to analyze the general performance of a web site. It provides similar  (but more limited) capabilities to the Windows Performance Toolkit (WPT) from right within the browser. More information on F12 can be found at [F12 Performance](../f12-devtools-guide).

## Looking to dig deep? [Try the Windows Performance Toolkit.](windows-performance-toolkit)
The Microsoft Edge team uses the Windows Performance Toolkit (WPT) for analyzing many aspects of the browser's performance. WPT was created by the Windows team to allow any program's performance to be analyzed in depth. It straddles the boundaries between website JavaScript and Microsoft Edge native code, allowing both to be viewed within the same tool. WPT can be used to:
 - Measure CPU time taken for software to complete work
 - Calculate the memory allocated by software
 - Show the details of downloading files from remote servers
 - Measure frame rate.
 More information on utilizing WPT to analyze a web site's performance in Microsoft Edge can be found at [Windows Performance Toolkit](windows-performance-toolkit).
